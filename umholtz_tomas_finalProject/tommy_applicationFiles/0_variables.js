var endMessage = "• Congratulations and thank you for playing SAR–EWGCOM \"Streets \'At\' Rage – East/West Gateway City of Money\", you have won the game! SAR–EWGCOM is not intended to be a political statement and may or may not be modeled (it probably is) on current geopolitical evens as of September 2019. The author would like to mention that he does condone or object to \"protesting\" or \"not protesting\", \"police action\" or \"not police action\" as reasoning behind peoples taking these actions can be very complex and can not be summed up with \"it's good\" or \"it's bad\". But, it is the author's desire to bring to the players attention that a free and open way of life isn't an entitlement that every person on earth is born with. By human nature people will take the path of least resistance to fulfill their basic survival needs. If repressing peoples is a viable means to this others will find it. It's up to those that desire freedom to actively understand, support and defending it from those who wish to encroach upon it.\n\n• SAR–EWGCOM Streets \'At\' Rage – East/West Gateway City of Money was produced by Tommy Umholtz as part of a final project for \"Project and Portfolio II\", a class taken at Full Sail University as part of its Web Design and Development degree program.\n\n© Tommy Umholtz – 2019\n\n";
